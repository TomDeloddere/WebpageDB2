        </h2>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">1. Which database design phase focuses on business concepts like entities and relationships, independent of a specific DBMS?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Conceptual Design</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>The Conceptual Design phase focuses on defining the high-level structure of the database in terms of entities, their attributes, and relationships, without tying it to a specific DBMS like DB2. This phase produces an Entity-Relationship (ER) model that represents business requirements in a platform-independent manner, serving as the foundation for subsequent logical and physical design phases.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">2. The process of eliminating repeating groups and ensuring atomic values corresponds to which Normal Form?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> 1NF</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>First Normal Form (1NF) requires that all attributes in a table contain atomic (indivisible) values and that repeating groups are eliminated. This ensures each column holds a single value per row, and each row is unique, forming the basis for further normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">3. True or False: Denormalization involves adding controlled redundancy to improve query performance.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> True</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>Denormalization is the intentional introduction of controlled redundancy into a database design to enhance query performance. By reducing the need for complex joins or improving data locality, denormalization can speed up read-heavy operations, though it may complicate updates and increase storage requirements.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">4. Which type of integrity constraint ensures that foreign key values match existing primary key values in the referenced table?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Referential Integrity</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>Referential Integrity ensures that foreign key values in a child table correspond to existing primary key values in the referenced parent table. This constraint maintains valid relationships between tables, preventing orphaned records and enforcing data consistency in DB2 through foreign key constraints.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">5. Eliminating transitive dependencies (where non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes) is the goal of ________ Normal Form.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> 3NF</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>Third Normal Form (3NF) eliminates transitive dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key. This reduces data redundancy and prevents update anomalies, building on 2NF by ensuring all attributes are directly dependent on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.</p>

        </h2>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">6. Which DB2 object maps logical tables to physical DASD storage?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Tablespace</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>A Tablespace in DB2 is the object that maps logical tables to physical DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) storage. It defines the storage structure for one or more tables, specifying how data is organized and stored on disk, including attributes like page size and partitioning strategy.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">7. An index that determines the physical storage order of rows in a table is called a ________ index.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Clustering</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>A Clustering index determines the physical storage order of rows in a table, optimizing data retrieval for queries that access data in the order of the index. DB2 attempts to maintain this order during data modifications, improving performance for range-based queries and sequential access.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">8. True or False: Range partitioning is typically based on system-generated sequence numbers.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> False</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>Range partitioning is typically based on meaningful column values, such as dates, codes, or numeric ranges, rather than system-generated sequence numbers. This allows data to be logically grouped into partitions based on business-relevant criteria, improving query performance and manageability.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">9. Which DB2 parameter controls the percentage of space left empty on a page during LOAD or REORG for future updates?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> PCTFREE</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>The PCTFREE parameter in DB2 specifies the percentage of space left empty on each page during LOAD or REORG operations to accommodate future updates or inserts. This free space helps prevent page splits and maintains performance by allowing rows to grow without requiring immediate reorganization.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">10. Optimizing a database schema specifically for reporting and analytics often involves using a ________ schema design.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Star</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>A Star schema is commonly used for optimizing database schemas for reporting and analytics. It features a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables, simplifying queries and improving performance for analytical workloads. Snowflake schemas, an extension of Star schemas, are also used but are more normalized.</p>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">11. Which DB2 object provides a logical grouping of related objects like tables and views within a database?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Schema</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>A Schema in DB2 is a logical grouping of related database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and stored procedures. It provides a namespace for organizing objects and managing access permissions, allowing multiple users or applications to work within the same database without naming conflicts.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">12. A virtual table derived from one or more base tables using a stored SELECT statement is a ________.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> View</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>A View in DB2 is a virtual table defined by a stored SELECT statement. It does not store data physically but dynamically retrieves data from underlying base tables when queried, providing a way to simplify complex queries, enforce security, or present data in a customized format.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">13. True or False: An Alias in DB2 is primarily used to define alternative access paths for performance.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> False</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>An Alias in DB2 is primarily used to provide an alternative name for a table or view, often for simplifying access, ensuring location transparency, or supporting distributed environments. It does not define alternative access paths for performance, which is typically handled by indexes or query optimization.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">14. Which type of temporary table is specific to a single application process and implicitly dropped?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Declared Temporary Table</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>A Declared Temporary Table (DTT) in DB2 is specific to a single application process and is implicitly dropped when the session ends. Unlike Global Temporary Tables, DTTs are not shared across sessions and are useful for temporary data storage during complex application processing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">15. Procedural logic automatically executed by DB2 in response to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations is implemented using ________.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Triggers</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>Triggers in DB2 are procedural logic defined to execute automatically in response to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table. They are used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, or automate tasks like logging changes, and can be defined as BEFORE, AFTER, or INSTEAD OF triggers.</p>

            <div class="question">16. Which clause in `CREATE INDEX` allows including additional columns in the index leaf pages to satisfy queries without accessing the table?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> INCLUDE</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>The INCLUDE clause in the `CREATE INDEX` statement allows additional non-key columns to be stored in the index leaf pages. This enables DB2 to satisfy certain queries directly from the index without accessing the underlying table, improving query performance through index-only access.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">17. True or False: A table can have multiple clustering indexes defined.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> False</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>A table in DB2 can have only one clustering index, as it determines the physical storage order of the table's rows. Multiple clustering indexes would conflict with the need for a single physical ordering, though a table can have multiple non-clustering indexes for other purposes.</p>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">18. A view created with the `WITH CHECK OPTION` clause restricts ________ operations on the view.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> INSERT</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>The `WITH CHECK OPTION` clause in a view definition restricts INSERT and UPDATE operations on the view to ensure that modified or inserted rows satisfy the view's WHERE condition. This enforces data integrity by preventing rows that would not be visible through the view from being added or modified.</p>

            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Materialized Query Table (MQT)</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>A Materialized Query Table (MQT) in DB2 physically stores the pre-computed results of a query, often used to optimize complex views or analytical queries. Unlike regular views, MQTs store data on disk, and their contents can be refreshed manually or automatically to reflect changes in the underlying tables.</p>

            <div class="question">20. In Declarative Referential Integrity (DRI), which `ON DELETE` rule automatically deletes child rows when the corresponding parent row is deleted?</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> CASCADE</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>The `ON DELETE CASCADE` rule in Declarative Referential Integrity (DRI) automatically deletes child rows in a dependent table when the corresponding parent row is deleted. This ensures referential integrity by preventing orphaned records and is commonly used when child records are meaningless without their parent.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-container">
            <div class="question">21. True or False: DB2 directly supports `ON UPDATE CASCADE` using declarative foreign key constraints.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> False</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <p>DB2 does not directly support `ON UPDATE CASCADE` using declarative foreign key constraints. To implement cascading updates (where changes to a parent table's primary key propagate to child table foreign keys), triggers or application logic must be used, as declarative constraints only support `ON DELETE` actions like CASCADE, SET NULL, or RESTRICT.</p>

            <div class="explanation">
                <p>The CHECK DATA utility in DB2 is used to verify referential integrity and check constraints, reporting any violations. It scans tables to ensure that foreign key values match primary key values in referenced tables and can place tablespaces in a CHECK-pending status if violations are found.</p>
